# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Hydro-Energy-in-Eastern-India

This project builds a time series forecasting model to predict hydro energy generation in Indiaâ€™s eastern region. By analyzing historical data on hydro, thermal, nuclear, and imported energy sources, the model provides accurate yearly forecasts. The results help compare energy production trends over time, supporting better planning and resource management.
